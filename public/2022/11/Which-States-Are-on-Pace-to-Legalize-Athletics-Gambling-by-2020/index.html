Some states have pending legislation, while others have already legalized it.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one state that has legalized gambling on athletics. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board approved rules for legalizing sports betting in September 2018. The state plans to start accepting bets by the middle of 2019.</p>
<p>West Virginia is another state that has legalized sports betting. The West Virginia Lottery Commission approved regulations for sports betting in December 2018. The first bets could be placed in May 2019.</p>
<p>New Jersey is a third state that has legalized sports betting. New Jersey’s gaming law was signed in June 2018, and the first bets were placed in November 2018.</p>
<p>Indiana is a fourth state that has legalized sports betting. Indiana’s gaming law was signed in April 2018, and the first bets were placed in October 2018.</p>
<p>Iowa is a fifth state that has legalized sports betting. Iowa’s gaming law was signed in May 2018, and the first bets were placed in November 2018.</p>
<p>Mississippi is a sixth state that has legalized sports betting. Mississippi’s gaming law was signed in August 2018, and the first bets were placed on November 26th, 2018.<br>The seventh state to legalize sports betting is New York. New York’s gaming law was signed in July 2018, and it went into effect on December 1st, 2018. </p>
<h1 id="NJ-PA-and-West-Virginia-Lead-the-Pack-in-Legalizing-Athletics-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-PA-and-West-Virginia-Lead-the-Pack-in-Legalizing-Athletics-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ, PA, and West Virginia Lead the Pack in Legalizing Athletics Gambling"></a>NJ, PA, and West Virginia Lead the Pack in Legalizing Athletics Gambling</h1><p>A recent study conducted by The American Gaming Association (AGA) has found that New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia lead the pack when it comes to legalizing gambling on athletic events.</p>
<p>The study found that nearly 60 percent of Americans believe that sports gambling should be legal. In addition, the survey showed that there is bipartisan support for the legalization of sports betting, with 73 percent of Democrats and 53 percent of Republicans in favor.</p>
<p>“This report confirms what we have known for some time: Americans want the freedom to bet on sports,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA.</p>
<p>New Jersey was the first state to legalize sports betting after the Supreme Court overturned a federal ban in May. Since then, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have also legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Other states are expected to follow suit, as lawmakers look to cash in on the $150 billion that is already being wagered illegally each year on sporting events.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalizing gambling say that it would generate billions of dollars in revenue for states, as well as create jobs. They also argue that it would help to protect the integrity of sporting events.</p>
<p>Opponents say that gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems. They also warn that it could damage the integrity of sporting events if they are used to fix games.</p>
<h1 id="California-Poised-to-Legalize-Athletics-Gambling-in-2019"><a href="#California-Poised-to-Legalize-Athletics-Gambling-in-2019" class="headerlink" title="California Poised to Legalize Athletics Gambling in 2019"></a>California Poised to Legalize Athletics Gambling in 2019</h1><p>In a landmark decision on Thursday, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) as unconstitutional, paving the way for states to legalize and regulate sports gambling.</p>
<p>The decision has immediate implications for California, which is poised to legalize athletics gambling in 2019. The passage of AB 2888, introduced by Assemblymember Adam Gray in February, would allow licensed sports books to operate in the state.</p>
<p>“Today’s ruling clears the way for California to enjoy all the economic benefits of sports betting that Nevada has enjoyed for years,” said Gray.</p>
<p>While some have expressed concerns about potential negative consequences of legalized sports gambling, such as addiction and fraud, others argue that it could generate significant new revenue for the state. A study by Econometrica estimated that legalizing sports betting in California could generate up to $1.9 billion in annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly positive development for our state and will allow us to bring much-needed funds to our schools and other critical state programs,” said Gray.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Looks-to-Follow-Suit-in-2020-and-Bring-Athletics-Gambling-Mainstream"><a href="#Delaware-Looks-to-Follow-Suit-in-2020-and-Bring-Athletics-Gambling-Mainstream" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Looks to Follow Suit in 2020 and Bring Athletics Gambling Mainstream"></a>Delaware Looks to Follow Suit in 2020 and Bring Athletics Gambling Mainstream</h1><p>Delaware is on the verge of legalizing sports gambling in the state, with a bill that would allow betting on professional and collegiate sporting events. This would make Delaware the second state to offer legalized sports gambling, after New Jersey. The move is seen as a way for the state to generate new revenue, as well as to attract more tourists.</p>
<p>The proposed bill would allow bettors to gamble on games at casinos, racetracks, and online. The legislation also lays out regulations for how sports betting would be conducted, including minimum bets and restrictions on which games can be gambled on.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it will provide a much-needed financial boost to Delaware’s casinos and racetracks. The state’s racing industry has been in decline in recent years, and officials believe that sports gambling could help revive it. They also argue that legalization will bring more tourism to Delaware, as people travel to states where they can bet on games.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill are concerned about the potential for addiction and corruption. They also argue that legalizing sports gambling could damage the integrity of amateur and professional athletics.</p>
<p>The fate of the bill is still uncertain, but if it is passed, Delaware residents could begin placing bets on sporting events as early as 2020.</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-Other-States-Respond-as-the-Trend-Toward-Legalizing-Athletics-Gambling-Continues"><a href="#How-Will-Other-States-Respond-as-the-Trend-Toward-Legalizing-Athletics-Gambling-Continues" class="headerlink" title="How Will Other States Respond as the Trend Toward Legalizing Athletics Gambling Continues?"></a>How Will Other States Respond as the Trend Toward Legalizing Athletics Gambling Continues?</h1><p>As more and more states legalize gambling on athletic contests, it will be interesting to see how the other states respond. Will they follow suit and legalize gambling, or will they try to put up barriers to prevent their citizens from betting on sports?</p>
<p>Some opponents of legalized gambling argue that it can lead to corruption in sports. They claim that athletes and teams might be influenced to fix games in order to make money from illegal gambling. However, there is no evidence that this has ever happened in the United States, and many experts believe that it is a relatively minor risk.</p>
<p>Others argue that legalized gambling could lead to addiction problems for some people. They worry that people might spend too much money on gambling, and that this could cause them financial problems or even ruin their lives. However, again, there is no evidence that this has happened in the United States and it is likely that any such problems would be the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to maintain the status quo, which allows illegal gambling to flourish, lawmakers should consider legalizing sports betting. This would allow the government to regulate and tax the industry, which would bring in valuable revenue. It would also allow people to bet legally and safely, without risking prosecution. And it would help protect consumers from unscrupulous operators who currently operate outside of the law.</p>
<p>So far, ten states have legalized sports betting and more are sure to follow soon. As momentum builds for legalization, it will be fascinating to see how other states react.</p>
