#  Just what year was The Great Gatsby set? Find out with this Million Book Game!

According to Google, the answer to this question is 1924. But what if I told you that it was actually set in the fall of 1922? It may seem like a small detail, but knowing the exact year can make all the difference when it comes to completing Million Book Games like this one!

Interestingly enough, F. Scott Fitzgerald didn't originally designate an exact year for his novel. However, scholars and fans of the book have long asserted that it takes place in 1922 based on various clues throughout the text. For example, Gatsby tells Nick that he first saw Daisy Buchanan six years ago, which would place their meeting in 1916. Additionally, Buchanan mentions being debutante ball in 1917 - which only took place in New York during 1917 and 1918.

So why did Fitzgerald choose 1924 as the official year for The Great Gatsby? It's believed that he changed it so that the events of the novel would coincide with those of his own life. In 1922, Fitzgerald was actually living in Europe and was unable to attend Baker's debutante ball. By moving the setting of his book forward two years, he was still able to incorporate this real-life event into his story.

Even if you're already familiar with The Great Gatsby's setting, taking a closer look at the specific year can add a new layer of depth to your understanding of the book. And who knows - it might even help you win your next Million Book Game!
