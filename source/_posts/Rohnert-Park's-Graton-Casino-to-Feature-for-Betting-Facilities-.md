#  Rohnert Park's Graton Casino to Feature for Betting Facilities 

The Rohnert Park City Council has unanimously voted to approve the Graton Resort and Casino, which will offer both casino and card room gaming. The casino, projected to open in November 2013, is located on a 286-acre site at the intersection of U.S. Highway 101 and state Highway 37. The Graton Resort and Casino will feature:

- A 120,000 square foot casino with 1,600 slots and 50 gaming tables
- A 30,000 square foot card room
- A 13-story hotel with 294 rooms
- A 740-space parking garage
- Restaurants, a spa and other amenities

In Sonoma County, the only other casinos are the Thunder Valley Casino Resort near Sacramento and the Jackson Rancheria Indian Resort near Jackson in Amador County. "This project is going to have a huge impact on our local economy," said Councilman Jake Mackenzie. "It's going to create hundreds of jobs and generate millions of dollars in revenue for the city."

Councilman Pat Payne said that he was pleased that the tribe had decided to use union labor for construction of the casino. "That's very important to me," Payne said. "I'm glad they're going to be using union labor." About 2,000 union workers are expected to be employed during construction of the casino. 

The tribe has agreed to pay Rohnert Park $1 million per year for 20 years plus 3 percent of annual revenues from the casino up to $3 million per year. The money will be used for traffic improvements, public safety and other needs in the city.

#  First California Casino with for Betting Facilities 




On September 15, 2018, the first California casino with betting facilities opened its doors to the public. The Fitz Casino and Hotel in Nevada is now the only place in California where you can place a bet on sporting events or play casino games. 

The Fitz Casino is a small casino located in the town of Wendover, Nevada, just across the state line from West Wendover, Nevada. The casino has been in operation since 1978 and features 350 slot machines and 14 table games. The Fitz also offers a sports book and a race and sports book. In addition to the gaming options, the Fitz Hotel offers 99 rooms and a buffet. 

While there are other casinos in California with betting facilities, those casinos are located in Indian reservations and not open to the general public. The Fitz Casino is open to anyone over 21 years of age who is willing to make the drive to Wendover. 

The opening of the Fitz Casino has not gone unnoticed by the other casinos in California. Within days of the opening of the Fitz, two of the largest Indian casinos in California announced they would be adding betting facilities to their casinos. 

The new Fitz Casino is good news for the town of Wendover. The Fitz employs 150 people and is one of the largest employers in Wendover. In addition, the Fitz pays more than $1 million a year in taxes to both Nevada and Utah. 

It will be interesting to see how this new development affects gambling revenues in Nevada and how it impacts tourism in Wendover and West Wendover

#  Graton Casino to Offer Unique for Betting Experience 

The Graton Casino plans to offer a unique experience for its guests who enjoy betting by introducing a new feature that will allow them to place their bets on their mobile devices. The casino announced this week that it has partnered with GeoComply, a company that provides geolocation software and services to the gaming industry, in order to offer this new feature.

With this new partnership, Graton Casino guests will now be able to place bets on sporting events and races through their smartphones or other mobile devices while inside the casino. This added convenience is expected to attract even more guests to the casino, as they will no longer have to go to a nearby sportsbook in order to make their bets. In addition, the casino's guests who are not from the United States will now be able to place bets on sporting events that are happening in their home countries.

Graton Casino is not the only gaming establishment that is looking for ways to offer its guests a better betting experience. A number of casinos around the world are now offering similar services that allow guests to bet on sporting events through their mobile devices. For example, CrownBet, an Australian online bookmaker, launched a new app last year that allows its customers to place bets on horse races and other sporting events through their smartphones.

While it is unclear if Graton Casino's new feature will be successful, it is clear that gambling establishments are looking for ways to modernize their services and appeal to a younger demographic. And with the increasing popularity of online betting, it is likely that more casinos will begin offering similar services in the near future.

#  Casino Welcomes for Betting Facilities into the State of California 

The booming casino industry in California could get a major boost from the state government, which is now considering legalizing sports betting and other forms of gambling. The news was first reported by Reuters and has since been confirmed by other media outlets.

If approved, the new law would allow casinos to offer betting on a variety of sporting events, as well as other popular forms of gambling such as poker and blackjack. The move is seen as a way to generate additional revenue for the cash-strapped state government, as well as to help support the casino industry which has been struggling in recent years.

Supporters of the new law argue that it will create jobs and promote economic growth, while opponents say that it will lead to increasedproblem gambling rates. However, there is no clear evidence that either side is correct, and it is likely that the true effects of legalizing gambling will only be seen over time.

Those in favour of the new law say that it would make California the biggest gambling market in North America, overtaking neighbouring Nevada. This could be a major boon to the stateâ€™s economy, as well as to its casino industry.
