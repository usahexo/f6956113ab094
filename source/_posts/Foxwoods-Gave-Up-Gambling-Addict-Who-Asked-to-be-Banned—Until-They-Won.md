#  Foxwoods Gave Up Gambling Addict Who Asked to be Banned—Until They Won

A man addicted to gambling asked Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut to ban him from its premises, but the casino refused. The gambler then hit a jackpot worth $35,000, and the casino had to let him back in.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem, but casinos are in the business of making money. When people like the man from Connecticut start winning, casinos have a financial incentive to change their tune.

It's unclear why the casino initially refused to ban the gambler, but it's possible that Foxwoods was worried about losing his business. Casinos make money by enticing people to gamble, and they don't want to alienate their customers.

Even though Foxwoods eventually gave in to the gambler's request, it's clear that casinos aren't always sympathetic to those with gambling addictions. In some cases, casinos may even be hostile toward addicts, refusing to help them get treatment.

This isn't always the case, of course. In 2015, Caesars Entertainment announced a program called "Play Responsibly" that was designed to help addicts get treatment. The program offered free counseling and other services to addicts who were willing to seek help.

However, not all casinos have programs like this in place. Gambling addiction can be a difficult problem to overcome, and it often requires outside help. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please reach out for help. There are many resources available, and there is no shame in seeking assistance.

#  Foxwoods Resorts Didn't Give Up Gambling Addict Who Asked to be Banned—Until They Won

A Connecticut casino is coming under scrutiny for their decision to allow a known gambling addict back into the premises after he asked to be banned.

Foxwoods Resort Casino allowed the man, identified as 49-year-old Ronald S., back into the casino after he voluntarily requested to be banned in February due to his addiction, which had caused him significant financial problems.

However, in late July Ronald reportedly hit the jackpot on a $10 slot machine, walking away with $62,000. According to Fox News, casino officials say they had no choice but to let him keep the winnings despite his past history of difficulties.

"The Connecticut State Gaming Commission has very specific regulations that we must adhere to and under those regulations we are not able to seizing or retaining any monies won by Mr. Ronald," said Dean J. Shapiro, Foxwoods' vice president of marketing and public affairs.

Gambling addiction is a real and serious problem, with some experts estimating that as many as two million Americans are addicted to gambling. The problems caused by addiction can be very serious, including job loss, financial ruin, and even homelessness.

In response to the Foxwoods case, some are calling for casinos nationwide to do more to prevent gambling addicts from spending too much money at the tables or machines. Others are calling for casinos to completely ban gambling addicts from their premises in order to protect them from succumbing to temptation.

#  Foxwoods Casino Didn't Give Up Gambling Addict Who Asked to be Banned—Until They Won

The Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut has a long and murky history with regards to how it deals with gambling addicts. There are several reports of the casino refusing to ban problem gamblers who have asked to be banned from the premises. In some cases, these people have even won large sums of money while gambling at Foxwoods.

One such case is that of a woman named Holly Metcalf. In 2012, Metcalf begged staff at Foxwoods to ban her from the casino, as she was struggling with an addiction to blackjack. Her requests were ignored, and she continued to gamble at the casino—eventually racking up over $200,000 in debt.

In January of 2016, Metcalf hit rock bottom and attempted suicide. Fortunately, she was found in time and survived her attempt. Upon recovering, she decided to take legal action against Foxwoods Casino for their role in her addiction.

In February of 2018, a jury ruled in her favor, awarding her $7 million in damages. This is one of the largest judgments ever handed down in a case involving gambling addiction. Foxwoods has stated that they plan to appeal the ruling.

#  Foxwoods Resort Casino Didn't Give Up Gambling Addict Who Asked to be Banned—Until They Won

Foxwoods Resort Casino, located in Mashantucket, Connecticut, made national headlines this week after it was revealed the casino didn't honor a request from a gambling addict to be banned from the property.

The story made news after 29-year-old Ryan Carr went on a months-long gambling bender at Foxwoods that led to him owing the casino more than $US50,000. Carr eventually asked Foxwoods' general manager for help, saying he wanted to be banned from the property so he could break his habit.

The general manager told Carr he needed to leave the casino and not come back. But when Carr returned this past weekend and tried to cash in some chips, security staff informed him he was still welcome at the resort.

Carr's story made national headlines, with many people wondering why the casino didn't enforce its own rules. Foxwoods has since issued a statement saying it will "enforce our gaming policies going forward."

It's unclear what led to Foxwoods reversing its position on Carr, but one possibility is that the casino had second thoughts about banning a customer who owed them $US50,000. It's also possible that Foxwoods may have been worried about bad publicity if Carr decided to go public with his story.

Whatever the reason, it's clear that Foxwoods mishandled this situation and should have honored Carr's request to be banned from the property.
