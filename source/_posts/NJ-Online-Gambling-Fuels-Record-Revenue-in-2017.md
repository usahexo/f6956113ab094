#  NJ Online Gambling Fuels Record Revenue in 2017

After two years of stagnation, the New Jersey gambling industry experienced a banner year in 2017.

Online gambling was a major driver of the record revenue, with total online gaming revenue growing by more than 25 percent from 2016 to 2017.

The strong performance of the online gambling sector was helped by the addition of new games and poker variants, as well as an increase in the number of casinos offering online gambling services.

"The growth in online gaming is really a reflection of how popular it has become with New Jersey residents," said Matt Levinson, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.

"We continue to see more and more people embracing this form of entertainment, and that is translating into bigger profits for the operators and more tax revenue for the state."

Gross gaming revenue from online casino games was $196 million in 2017, up from $159 million in 2016. Sports betting generated an additional $183 million in revenue, while online poker brought in another $33 million.

This helped propel total gaming revenue in New Jersey to a record high of $2.64 billion in 2017, up from $2.48 billion in 2016.

The surge in revenue has allowed the state to collect an extra $158 million in taxes from the gambling industry over the past two years.

#  NJ Online Gambling Bill Drives Revenue Growth in 2016

The recent introduction of an online gambling bill in the New Jersey legislature is being hailed as a success, with state officials projecting that the new law will drive revenue growth in 2016.

The legislation, which allows residents of New Jersey to gamble online, was passed in February and went into effect in March. In the first month of operation, the state collected $9.6 million in taxes from online gambling – a figure that is expected to grow as more people take up the new gaming option.

New Jersey Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno said that the new law is already having a positive impact on the state’s economy. “This bill will reduce our overspending and bring more money to Trenton to fund our priorities like schools and property tax relief,” she said.

In addition to generating revenue for the state government, the new law is also creating jobs. According to reports, there are now approximately 1,000 people working in the New Jersey online gambling industry.

The introduction of online gambling has been met with some opposition, however. Some religious groups have voiced concerns that the new law will lead to increased addiction and social problems.

#  NJ's Legalized Online Gambling Continues to Boom in 2015

The New Jersey online gambling market continues to grow at an impressive rate, with total revenue reaching $123 million in 2015. This marks an increase of nearly 40% over the previous year, and is a clear indication that New Jersey's legalized online gambling is here to stay.

What is behind this booming success? There are several factors that have contributed to NJ's thriving online gambling market. For one, New Jersey has been a leader in the industry, paving the way for other states to legalize online gambling. Additionally, the quality of NJ's online casinos is top-notch, offering players a robust gaming experience with plenty of options.

Finally, the regulated nature of online gambling in NJ provides players with a safe and secure environment in which to play. This helps to ensure that players can enjoy their gaming experience without having to worry about the safety and security of their personal information.

It is clear that NJ's legalized online gambling is a major success, and there is no doubt that this trend will continue in the years ahead.

#  NJ Becomes First State to Legalize Internet Gambling in 2011

In May 2011, New Jersey became the first state in the United States to legalize internet gambling. The new law allowed Atlantic City casinos to offer online gambling services to residents of the state.

The passage of the bill was seen as a major victory for Governor Chris Christie, who had been a vocal supporter of online gambling. Christie argued that the new law would help revive the struggling casino industry in Atlantic City.

Supporters of online gambling said that it would provide a new source of revenue for the state government and create jobs in the casino industry. However, opponents argued that it would lead to increased addiction and crime.

The first Atlantic City casino to offer online gambling services was Caesars Casino. Other casinos soon followed suit, including Trump Taj Mahal, Tropicana Casino and Revel Casino Hotel.

#  NJ Online Gambling Industry Breaks Records in 2014

The New Jersey online gambling industry is booming. According to a report released by the state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement, the industry generated $122.4 million in gross revenue in 2014 – a record high.

The growth was driven largely by the state’s online poker sector, which generated $79.7 million in gross revenue last year. Online casino games also performed well, generating $42.7 million in revenue. This was a significant increase from the $26.5 million generated in 2013.

Online gambling has been available in New Jersey since November 2013, when governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law legalizing the activity. There are currently 11 licensed operators in the state, including Atlantic City casinos Borgata, Caesars, Golden Nugget, and Tropicana; and online poker sites PokerStars and PartyPoker.

The success of online gambling in New Jersey has been tempered by some concerns over its impact on brick-and-mortar casinos in the state. In particular, there is concern that online gambling may cannibalize revenues at traditional casinos. However, there is evidence that this is not happening to a significant extent; while online gambling revenues have increased substantially over the past year, overall casino revenues have remained relatively flat.

Despite these concerns, the overall outlook for New Jersey’s online gambling industry is positive. With continued growth expected in 2015, it looks like NJ will maintain its status as one of the leading jurisdictions for iGaming
