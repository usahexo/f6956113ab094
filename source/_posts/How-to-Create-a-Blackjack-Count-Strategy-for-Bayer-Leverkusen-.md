#  How to Create a Blackjack Count Strategy for Bayer Leverkusen 

In this article, we will discuss how to create a blackjack count strategy for Bayer Leverkusen.

To get started, you will need to know the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the goal is to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible. However, you cannot go over 21. Additionally, you can either hit (take another card) or stand (end your turn).

Once you understand the basic rules of blackjack, it is time to start creating your count strategy. In blackjack, there are two main types of counts: level 1 and level 2. Level 1 counts are simpler and are good for beginners. Level 2 counts are more complex and require a lot more memorization.

For Bayer Leverkusen, we recommend using a level 1 count strategy. To start off, you will need to keep track of the following factors:
-The number of decks in use
-The player's total points
-The dealer's up card
Once you have all of this information handy, you can start counting cards. In general, when the total points are 6 or lower, you should hit; when the total points are 7 or higher, you should stand. However, this is not always the case - for example, if the dealer's up card is a 6 or lower, you should still hit even if your total points are 7 or higher. You can find more specific information on your particular count strategy by checking out an online blackjack cheat sheet.

Keep in mind that counting cards is not an exact science - there is always some element of chance involved. However, using a good count strategy can give you a significant edge over the dealer and improve your chances of winning. So make sure to take the time to learn and practice a blackjack count strategy before playing Bayer Leverkusen!

◦Classify each card as either high (10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings) or low (2s through 6s). When the deck is rich in high cards, it is advantageous to bet more aggressively. Conversely, when the deck is rich in low cards, it is advantageous to bet more conservatively. 
◦Keep track of how many high cards and low cards have been played. This information can help you determine whether or not the deck is biased towards high or low cards. 
◦Adjust your betting pattern according to how much advantage you believe counting gives you. For instance, if you believe that counting gives you a 1% edge over the casino, then you should bet 1% more than you would otherwise when the deck is favourable and bet 1% less when the deck is unfavourable.

One popular counting system is the Hi-Lo count. With this method, you assign a value of +1 or -1 to each card depending on its rank. Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 6s are worth 0 points, 7s through 10s are worth 1 point, and a Jack, Queen or King (JQK) are worth -2 points.

# The basics of blackjack 

Blackjack is a card game that is played between a player and a dealer. The aim of the game is to score 21 points or to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In blackjack, each card has a different point value: 

Aces = 1 point 
2s to 10s = face value 
Jacks, Queens and Kings (J,Q,K) = 10 points 
An Ace counted as 11 points or 1 point depending on what makes a better hand. 
A Deuce (2) counted as 2 points 
Each other card counted at its face value.


The player’s goal is to take cards until they reach 21 points or come closer than the dealer without going over 21. If the player goes over 21 points, they ‘bust’ and lose the hand. If both the player and dealer have over 21 points at the end of the hand, then it is called a ‘push’ and no one wins or loses money on that particular hand. 

# The basic strategy for blackjack 
Now that you know how blackjack works, it is important to learn about basic strategy if you want to have any chance against the dealer. In general, your aim should be to minimise losses and maximise gains when playing blackjack - which is precisely what basic strategy helps you do. Basic strategy tells you what move to make in every possible situation during a game of blackjack so that your chances of winning are as high as possible. You can find basic strategy charts online which will tell you what move to make in every scenario, but we will go over some of the most important rules here: 

First and foremost: always stand when you have 17 or more points . This gives you the best chance of not busting and winning the hand. 

If you have 16 points, then hit against any number except an Ace if the dealer shows an Ace or Deuce (soft 17). If the dealer has 2 through 6 showing, then hit regardless of your own card total . This increases your chances of not busting and avoiding losing money on that particular hand.

If you have 14 or 15 points , then stand against any dealer total except an Ace if he shows an Ace or Deuce (soft 17). Against all other dealers’ totals, hit if your first two cards add up to 14 or less; otherwise stand . This also increases your chances of not busting and avoiding losses on individual hands.

Finally: always double down when you have 11 points . Doubling down means increasing your bet by 100% once you have been dealt your first two cards - so if you double down with $10 then your new bet will be $20. Doing this improves your chances of winning significantly since it allows you to add an additional card to your initial two cards without risking too much money outright.

#  How do you win with blackjack count strategy Bayer 04 Leverkusen?

When you play blackjack, it is important to employ a count strategy to increase your odds of winning. One such strategy is the Bayer 04 Leverkusen, which takes its name from the German football club.

The Bayer 04 Leverkusen count strategy is a point-count system that assigns a value to each card in the deck in order to determine when it is advantageous to take an extra card or stand pat. It is based on the Hi-Lo count system, with a few modifications.

In order to use the Bayer 04 Leverkusen count strategy, you need to first memorize the point values for all cards: 2 through 9 are worth face value; 10s and face cards are worth 0 points; and aces are worth 1 point.

When you are dealt two cards, add their points together to get your running total. If this number is 6 or lower, you should take another card; if it is 7 or higher, you should stand pat. When it comes to split pairs, always take another card if the new running total is 6 or lower; if it is 7 or higher, stand pat.

If you are dealt three cards, add their points together to get your running total; if this number is 8 or lower, you should take another card; if it is 9 or higher, you should stand pat. As with split pairs, always take another card if the new running total is 8 or lower; if it is 9 or higher, stand pat.

If you are dealt four cards, add their points together to get your running total; if this number is 10 or lower, you should take another card; if it is 11 or higher, you should stand pat. As with split pairs and three-card hands, always take another card if the new running total is 10 or lower; if it is 11 or higher, stand pat.

If you are dealt five cards (or more), add their points together to get your running total. You should always take an extra card in this situation. This will give you the best possible chance of having a hand that totals 21 (or as close as possible) and thereby winning the game.
