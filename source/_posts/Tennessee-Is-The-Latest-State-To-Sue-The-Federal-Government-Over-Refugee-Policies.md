#  Tennessee Is The Latest State To Sue The Federal Government Over Refugee Policies

Tennessee has become the latest state to sue the federal government over its refugee policies. The Republican-controlled state legislature filed a lawsuit on Monday morning, alleging that the Obama administration has failed to consult with states adequately over the placement of refugees.

The state is asking the court to stop the federal government from placing any more refugees in Tennessee until it can prove that it has adequately consulted with state officials.

“It seems like they’re just completely disregarding states’ rights, and we just need to do something about it,” said State Rep. Terri Lynn Weaver, a sponsor of the measure.

Tennessee is not alone in its concerns over refugee resettlement. Earlier this month, several states sued the federal government over its plans to place Syrian refugees in the United States. The states, led by Texas, argue that the Obama administration has failed to provide enough information about how it plans to vet refugees for terrorist ties.

The Obama administration has responded by saying that it takes states’ concerns seriously and has been working closely with them on refugee resettlement. It also argues that the president has the authority to admit refugees without consulting with Congress or states.

This latest lawsuit is just one more example of the growing tension between Republicans and the Obama administration over immigration policy. Republicans have repeatedly tried to block President Obama’s efforts to reform immigration laws, arguing that he is overstepping his authority.

#  Tennessee Will Not House Refugees, Nashville Says

Tennessee will not be opening their arms to house refugees, following the lead of Nashville Mayor Megan Barry.

In a statement, Barry said that Nashville will not participate in the federal refugee resettlement program, despite the Obama administration’s insistence that local communities are a vital part of the process.

“Nashville is a welcoming city and always has been, but we must do our due diligence to ensure we are not putting our citizens at risk,” Mayor Barry said.

Barry joins a growing number of U.S. mayors who have decided to opt out of the resettlement program in light of recent terrorist attacks in Paris and California. Republican governors across the country have also threatened to halt resettlement in their states, despite President Obama’s assurances that refugees are rigorously screened before being allowed into America.

The move comes as a surprise to some who see Nashville as a model for how cities can successfully integrate refugees into their communities. In recent years, Nashville has seen an influx of refugees from countries such as Somalia and Burma, with many finding success in businesses and other aspects of life in the city.

Mayor Barry insists that her decision does not reflect a lack of compassion for those fleeing persecution, but rather is based on safety concerns for Nashville residents. She said the city will continue to work with refugees who have already settled there and will offer them support in any way possible.

#  Knoxville Mayor: We'll House Refugees If Memphis Won't

Last week, Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero announced that her city would open its doors to refugees if Memphis didn't want them. The offer came in response to the news that the Tennessee Department of Health was refusing to renew the permit for CatholicCharities of Memphis to resettle refugees in Shelby and Fayette counties.

"If our state government is going to turn its back on these families who are fleeing violence and persecution, then Knoxville will welcome them," said Mayor Rogero.

Catholic Charities had been resettling refugees in the Memphis area since 1975, but they were told last month that their permit would not be renewed because the department claimed there were enough resettlement agencies in the area. However, Catholic Charities is the only agency that resettles refugees from Africa and the Middle East.

Mayor Rogero's offer has been welcomed by the local community. "We wholeheartedly support Mayor Rogero's compassionate offer to house refugees who have been refused by our state government," said Rev. Keith Norman, senior pastor at First Baptist Church-Broad Avenue."These families are innocent people who are fleeing violence and persecution, and we should do everything we can to help them."

So far, there has been no response from the Memphis city government about Mayor Rogero's offer.

#  Chattanooga Mayor Considering Housing Refugees

Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke is considering a proposal to house refugees in the city. The proposal would bring 100 refugees to Chattanooga within the next year.

This proposal comes at a time when the United States has significantly reduced the number of refugees it will accept in the upcoming fiscal year. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that capped refugee admissions at 50,000 for the fiscal year, compared to the 110,000 cap set by former President Barack Obama.

Mayor Berke has said that he is open to housing refugees, regardless of their religion or ethnicity. "We want to make sure that we're doing our part and that we're welcoming people who are fleeing some of the worst violence and terrorism in the world," he said.

Some community members have voiced opposition to the proposal, citing concerns about crime and terrorism. Others have argued that Chattanooga should do more to assist refugees, given its prominent role in the civil rights movement.

In light of these concerns, Mayor Berke has formed a task force to study the feasibility of housing refugees in Chattanooga. The task force will consider factors such as cost, infrastructure needs, and community reaction.

#  State Legislators File Bills To Stop Syrian Refugees In Tennessee

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A handful of Tennessee state legislators have filed bills to stop the relocation of Syrian refugees to the state in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris.

Republican Reps. Jay Reedy of Erin, Sheila Butt of Columbia, and Judd Matheny of Tullahoma introduced a bill on Monday that would prevent the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Tennessee unless they are sponsored by a church or synagogue.

Republican Sens. Bill Ketron of Murfreesboro and Mark Green of Clarksville filed a similar measure on Tuesday. Republican Gov. Bill Haslam said Monday he'll ask the federal government to stop resettling Syrian refugees in Tennessee.

President Barack Obama has pledged to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over the next fiscal year.
