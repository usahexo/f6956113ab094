  # Seated rows  Begin by sitting on the edge of a bench or chair with a weight in each hand, palms facing your thighs. Your feet should be flat on the ground and slightly wider than hip-width apart. Lean back just far enough to feel a stretch in your hamstrings, then row the weights up to the sides of your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body. Pause and squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top of the row before slowly lowering the weights back to starting position 

  # Dumbbell shoulder press Sit on the edge of a bench with a weight in each hand, arms bent and palms facing forward. Lift the weights overhead, extending your arms until they’re straightened, then slowly lower them back to the starting position 

  # Bench dips Place both hands on a bench with your fingers pointing forward and legs extended out in front of you so that your heels are resting on top of another bench (or use two chairs). Keeping your core engaged, slowly lower yourself down by bending your elbows until they’re at a 90-degree angle, then press back up to starting position 

  # Lat pulldowns Sit at a lat pulldown machine with a wide bar attached to the top pulley and shoulder-width apart stance. Grip the bar with an overhand grip (palms away from you) and contract your lats to pull the bar down until it touches either just below or above your collarbone. Pause and squeeze before slowly returning to start position 

  # Cable crossover flies Stand between two cable machines with weights in each hand, arms parallel to each other and slightly bent at the elbow. Pull both cables across your body so that they meet in front of you; pause and squeeze before returning them to start position 

  # Hammer curls Start by holding a weight in each hand with palms facing your thighs. Curl both weights up towards your shoulders while keeping them close to your body - do not let them swing away from you as you curl them up! Pause and squeeze before slowly lowering them back down towards the starting position
