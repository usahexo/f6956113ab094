#  NY Taxpayers Lose Millions Annually On Illegal Sports Betting

It’s no secret that New York state taxpayers are losing millions of dollars every year on illegal sports betting. In fact, some reports estimate that the amount lost could be as high as $1 billion annually. This is a significant problem, as illegal sports betting takes money away from both the government and honest businesses.

Illegal sports betting is a problem in New York state for a few reasons. First,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) it’s hard to track down and prosecute those who are engaged in this activity. secondly, there is no regulation or oversight of illegal sports betting, meaning that consumers don’t have any protections when they place bets. Finally, illegal sports betting fuels other forms of organized crime, such as prostitution and drug trafficking.

So what can be done to address this issue? First, the state government should allocate more resources to tracking down and prosecuting those who engage in illegal sports betting. Secondly, the state should work with the gambling industry to develop better regulations for legal sports betting. This would help ensure that consumers are protected when they place bets, and it would also help to crackdown on illegal activity. Finally, the state should invest in public education campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of illegal sports betting.

In conclusion, New York state taxpayers are losing millions of dollars every year on illegal sports betting. This is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

#  NJ To Start Taxing Sports Betting In February

New Jersey officials have announced that the state will start taxing sports betting in February. This move comes after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting last month.

The tax rate for sports betting in New Jersey will be 10 percent of profits. This is lower than the tax rates for other forms of gambling, such as casino games and online poker, which are taxed at 15 percent.

Officials say that the lower tax rate for sports betting is necessary to ensure that the industry can compete with illegal bookmakers.

“We don’t want to impose a rate that either encourages or discourages people from engaging in this activity,” said Treasury Department spokesman Scott Hardman.

Sports betting was previously illegal in New Jersey, but the Supreme Court ruling opens the door for states to legalize it. Several other states, including Delaware and West Virginia, have also announced plans to legalize sports betting in the coming months.

#  Pennsylvania Considers 9.75% Tax On Sports Betting Revenue

Pennsylvania is one of the states considering implementing a 9.75% tax on sports betting revenue, in addition to the other taxes that are already in place.

This move would allow the state to collect $12 million annually in additional revenue. The bill was proposed by Democratic Representative Brian Sims and is currently under review.

The proposal comes at a time when other states are legalizing sports betting and Pennsylvania is hoping to get a piece of the pie. The state has been struggling financially in recent years and could use the extra revenue.

However, there is some opposition to the proposal. Some lawmakers feel that the 9.75% tax is too high and will drive business out of state. They would like to see a lower tax rate or no tax at all.

It remains to be seen whether the proposal will pass and how much revenue it will generate for Pennsylvania. In the meantime, sports betting fans can continue placing their bets and waiting for the outcome.

#  West Virginia Sports Betting Revenue Could Bring In $5M In Tax Revenue

Governor Jim Justice announced that the state of West Virginia could see up to $5M in tax revenue from legalized sports betting. The governor made the statement on Thursday, June 14, at a news conference held in conjunction with the launch of Mountaineer Sports Properties, a new partnership between the state’s Department of Commerce and its flagship university, West Virginia University.

Justice said that he is “absolutely convinced” that sports betting will be a major boon to the state’s economy. “I think it has a chance to be one of the biggest things ever happened to us, as far as revenue is concerned,” he said.

In response to a reporter’s question about how much money the state stands to make from sports betting, Justice said that it is too early to say for certain, but estimated that tax revenue could reach as high as $5M per year. He added that he expects sports betting to create 1,500 new jobs in the state.

West Virginia became the first state in the nation to legalize sports betting following last month’s US Supreme Court ruling in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The high court overturned a law that had prohibited states from legalizing sports betting.

Justice was an advocate of overturning the law and pushed for legislation authorizing sports betting in West Virginia even before the Supreme Court issued its ruling. The bill was passed by the state legislature and signed into law by Governor Justice on March 29.

Under the law, West Virginians will be able to place wagers on professional and college sporting events via mobile apps and online websites licensed by the state lottery commission. College games will be off-limits for bettors in West Virginia unless they take place in-state. Gambling on high school games is also prohibited.

#  Indiana Bill Would Charge 10% Tax On Gambling Winnings

Indiana is considering a bill that would charge a 10% tax on gambling winnings. The bill is currently making its way through the state legislature.

The proposed bill would add a 10% tax to all gambling winnings in Indiana, including lottery winnings, casino winnings, and race track winnings. The revenue generated by the tax would be used to fund infrastructure projects in the state.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will drive gamblers elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for the state. They also argue that it is unfair to tax lucky people who happen to win money at gambling establishments.

Supporters of the bill argue that the tax is necessary to generate revenue for important infrastructure projects. They also argue that it is only fair to tax gambling winnings, since gambling is already taxed at other levels.

The bill has yet to be passed, but it is receiving significant attention in the legislature. It will likely be voted on in the near future.
